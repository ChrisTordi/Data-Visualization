How to read visualizations:

SPLOM:


Parallel Coordinates: Our parallel coordinates visualization is made up of 5
vertical bar. Each bar represents a column from our csv file with points placed
along each bar according to their respective values. The lines serve to relate
multiple data points from the same flight to allow viewers to discern
relationships between the data.

Hovering over a line highlights each line red and displays a tooltip for that
specific flight. Moving the cursor off of the line will return the color to
blue. Clicking a line will toggle each line for that flight and turn those lines
red and increase line thickness. This will persist until one of the lines
associated with that flight is clicked again.

The animations and interactions allow viewers to easily see relationships
within a flight and compared to other flights. The coloring scheme also makes
flights that are hovered over "pop-out"
